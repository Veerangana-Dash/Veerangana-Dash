Hi! I'm a backend developer for IOT products at RBEI (Bosch). I've previously been a part of IoT teams as a gateway software developer. 
I'm gathering experience in software development in the IoT domain. Additionally, I'm also a Machine and Deep Learning enthusiast and have recently started exploring Data Science. I've previously worked on fullstack development projects using Spring and Angular to build POCs. I am also a part of a team project "Smart Carrom" built on Rasp-PI and ML, which has been officially set-up in Bosch Bangalore IOT Garage to showcase the unique and unconventional use-cases of IOT.
